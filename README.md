# Banuba Filters Demo – React Native TRIAL

An experimental React Native application using **Banuba SDK** for fun face filters and short video recording—like a mini Snapchat clone.  
Currently a work-in-progress, meant for testing and demonstrating Banuba's AR features.

## Features
- Real-time AR face filters
- Short video capture with filters applied
- Snapchat-like camera preview
- Works on Android & iOS
- Built with React Native + Banuba SDK

## Status
⚠️ Prototype: Expect bugs, incomplete UI, and missing features.

## How It Works
1. Open the app and allow camera/microphone permissions.
2. Select a filter from the demo set.
3. Record short videos with your chosen effect.

## Requirements
- Banuba SDK license (trial or production)
- React Native development environment set up
- Android/iOS device with camera
